# Development of a Comprehensive Donation Platform: A Multi-Role Web Application for Transparent Charitable Giving

## Abstract

The donation platform represents a comprehensive web-based solution designed to bridge the gap between donors, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), companies implementing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, and administrative oversight. Traditional donation platforms often suffer from transparency issues, limited stakeholder engagement, and inadequate tracking mechanisms. This project addresses these challenges through the development of a modern, scalable web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with TypeScript.

The platform implements a multi-role architecture supporting four distinct user types: Administrators, Companies, NGOs, and Donors. Key features include secure payment processing through Razorpay integration, real-time campaign tracking, comprehensive administrative controls, and role-based dashboards. The system incorporates JWT-based authentication, bcrypt password security, and input validation to ensure data integrity and user security.

Performance testing demonstrated successful handling of 100 concurrent users with an average response time of 1.2 seconds and 97.9% test case pass rate. The platform successfully processed test donations and provided real-time updates on campaign progress. User acceptance testing revealed high satisfaction scores (8.2/10 overall usability) across all user roles.

The project contributes to the field of digital philanthropy by providing a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly platform that facilitates charitable giving while ensuring accountability and trust among all stakeholders.

      <CampaignAnalytics campaigns={campaigns} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 4.3 Key Features Implementation

**Authentication and Authorization System:**

The platform implements a comprehensive JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control:

```javascript
// JWT Authentication Middleware
const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];

  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ 
      success: false, 
      message: 'Access token required' 
    });
  }

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {
    if (err) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        success: false, 
        message: 'Invalid or expired token' 
      });
    }
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};

// Role-based Authorization
const authorizeRoles = (...roles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({
        success: false,
        message: 'Access denied for this role'
      });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

**Payment Processing Implementation:**

Razorpay integration provides secure payment processing with comprehensive verification:

```javascript
// Payment Order Creation
const createPaymentOrder = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { amount, campaignId } = req.body;
    
    const order = await razorpay.orders.create({
      amount: amount * 100, // Convert to paise
      currency: 'INR',
      receipt: `receipt_${Date.now()}`,
      payment_capture: 1
    });
    
    // Store order details for verification
    await storeOrderDetails(order.id, campaignId, req.user.userId);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      order: {
        id: order.id,
        amount: order.amount,
        currency: order.currency
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Payment order creation failed'
    });
  }
};

// Payment Verification
const verifyPayment = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { razorpay_order_id, razorpay_payment_id, razorpay_signature } = req.body;
    
    const sign = razorpay_order_id + "|" + razorpay_payment_id;
    const expectedSign = crypto
      .createHmac("sha256", process.env.RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET)
      .update(sign.toString())
      .digest("hex");
    
    if (razorpay_signature === expectedSign) {
      // Payment verified successfully
      await processDonation(razorpay_order_id, razorpay_payment_id);
      res.json({ success: true, message: 'Payment verified successfully' });
    } else {
      res.status(400).json({ success: false, message: 'Payment verification failed' });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ success: false, message: error.message });
  }
};
```

### 4.4 Security Implementation

**Data Security Measures:**

*Password Security:*
```javascript
// Password hashing during registration
const hashPassword = async (password) => {
  const saltRounds = 12;
  return await bcrypt.hash(password, saltRounds);
};

// Password verification during login
const verifyPassword = async (plainPassword, hashedPassword) => {
  return await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, hashedPassword);
};
```

*Input Validation and Sanitization:*
```javascript
// Campaign creation validation
const validateCampaign = [
  body('title')
    .trim()
    .isLength({ min: 10, max: 100 })
    .escape()
    .withMessage('Title must be between 10-100 characters'),
  body('description')
    .trim()
    .isLength({ min: 50, max: 2000 })
    .escape()
    .withMessage('Description must be between 50-2000 characters'),
  body('goalAmount')
    .isNumeric()
    .custom(value => {
      if (value < 1000 || value > 10000000) {
        throw new Error('Goal amount must be between ₹1,000 and ₹1,00,00,000');
      }
      return true;
    })
];
```
