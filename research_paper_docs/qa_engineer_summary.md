#### Sample API Test Case
```javascript
// Login API Test
pm.test("Login with valid credentials", function () {
    const responseJson = pm.response.json();
    
    pm.expect(pm.response.code).to.equal(200);
    pm.expect(responseJson.success).to.be.true;
    pm.expect(responseJson.token).to.exist;
    pm.expect(responseJson.user.role).to.be.oneOf(['admin', 'company', 'ngo', 'donor']);
    
    // Set token for subsequent requests
    pm.environment.set("authToken", responseJson.token);
});
```

  let campaignId;
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Setup authentication
    const loginResponse = await request(app)
      .post('/api/auth/login')
      .send({
        email: 'ngo@test.com',
        password: 'password123'
      });
    authToken = loginResponse.body.token;
  });
  
  it('should create campaign with valid data', async () => {
    const campaignData = {
      title: 'Test Campaign',
      description: 'Test Description',
      goalAmount: 50000,
      category: 'education'
    };
    
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/campaigns')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
      .send(campaignData);
    
    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.body.success).toBe(true);
    expect(response.body.campaign.title).toBe(campaignData.title);
    
    campaignId = response.body.campaign._id;
  });
  
  it('should reject campaign with invalid data', async () => {
    const invalidData = {
      title: '', // Empty title
      goalAmount: -100 // Negative amount
    };
    
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/campaigns')

## Bug Reports and Issue Tracker Summary

### Critical Bugs Found and Resolved

#### Bug Report #001
```
Title: Payment verification fails with Razorpay webhook
Severity: Critical
Priority: High
Environment: Production

Description:
Payment webhook signature verification failing intermittently, 
causing successful payments to show as failed in the system.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Make donation using Razorpay
2. Complete payment successfully
3. Webhook received but signature verification fails
4. Payment shows as "failed" in admin panel

Root Cause:
Incorrect webhook secret environment variable configuration

Resolution:

- Added additional logging for debugging
- Implemented retry mechanism for failed verifications

Status: ✓ RESOLVED
```

#### Bug Report #002
```
Title: File upload size limit not enforced on frontend
Severity: Medium
Priority: Medium
Environment: Development

Description:
Users can select files larger than 5MB limit, causing upload 
failures without proper error messages.

Resolution:
- Added client-side file size validation
- Improved error messaging
- Added progress indicators for large uploads

Status: ✓ RESOLVED
```

### Performance Issues Identified

#### Issue #001: Database Query Optimization
```
Problem: Campaign listing page loading slowly with large datasets
Impact: User experience degradation
Solution: 
- Added database indexing on frequently queried fields
